<h1>Part 1: How to use VS Code with GitHub</h1>
<p>
    <br>1. Before working with GitHub in VS Code, make sure you have VS Code installed. You can install it using this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
    <br>2. After VS Code is installed, install GitHub for your desktop and create a GitHub account. You can install GitHub for your desktop using this link: https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop
    <br>3. Once you have a GitHub account and VS Code, create a GitHub repository. Do this by clicking the + icon on the top-right corner of github.com.
    <br>4. Give your repository a descriptive name. Make sure your repository is public as well. When you are finished creating a repository, navigate your way to VS Code. 
    <br>5. In the VS Code homepage, locate the option to clone your Git repository ("Clone Git Repository). Choose the repository you wish to clone onto your machine. After cloning, you have successfully connected your VS Code interface with GitHub.
    <br>6. Create a file in VS Code to start scripting. 
    <br>7. To sync your edits with your GitHub repository, locate the "Source Control" icon to the left. 
    <br>8. After locating the "Source Control," there is a blue button that will commit your script and push it to your GitHub Repository. Before committing, it is advised to add a message to let others know of your pushes. 
    <br> You are now ready to use GitHub in VS Code

<h1>Part 2: Definition of Terms</h1>
<ul>
    <br><li><b>Branch</b></li> - a parallel version of a repository; allows users to work freely without affecting the main branch
    <br><li><b>Clone</b></li> - a copy of your repository that exists locally on your own machine instead of on a website's server elsewhere
    <br><li><b>Commit</b></li> - AKA "a revision;" a change a user makes to a file; each commit is recorded in GitHub and lets other developers know of the changes that look place
    <br><li><b>Fetch</b></li> - allows developers to make changes to their local working branch without the commitment
    <br><li><b>GIT</b></li> - an open source program that is used to track changes in text files; the core technology that GitHub is built on top of
    <br><li><b>Github</b></li> - a platform where several developers can create, edit, and share their own code to other developers
    <br><li><b>Merge</b></li> - takes the changes in one branch and applies it to another; can be done via pull request
    <br><li><b>Merge Conflict</b></li> - occurs when developers make different changes to the same line of code; these must be resolved before one merges branches
    <br><li><b>Push</b></li> - the process of sending your commited changes to a GitHub repository; you can push your changes so that others can access them
    <br><li><b>Pull</b></li> - the process of obtaining changes and merging them; when working on a collaborative file, you can pull in changes other developers make into your local copy
    <br><li><b>Remote</b></li> - the version of a repository/branch that is hosted on a server
    <br><li><b>Repository</b></li> - GitHub's most basic element; acts like a project folder that holds all of the files of a project
