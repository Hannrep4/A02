<h1>Part 1: How to use VS Code with GitHub</h1>
<p>
    <br>1. Before working with GitHub in VS Code, make sure you have VS Code installed. You can install it using this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
    <br>2. After VS Code is installed, install GitHub for your desktop and create a GitHub account. You can install GitHub for your desktop using this link: https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop
    <br>3. Once you have a GitHub account and VS Code, create a GitHub repository. Do this by clicking the + icon on the top-right corner of github.com.
    <br>4. Give your repository a descriptive name. Make sure your repository is public as well. When you are finished creating a repository, navigate your way to VS Code. 
    <br>5. In the VS Code homepage, locate the option to clone your Git repository ("Clone Git Repository). Choose the repository you wish to clone onto your machine. After cloning, you have successfully connected your VS Code interface with GitHub.
    <br>6. Create a file in VS Code to start scripting. 
    <br>7. To sync your edits with your GitHub repository, locate the "Source Control" icon to the left. 
    <br>8. After locating the "Source Control," there is a blue button that will commit your script and push it to your GitHub Repository. Before committing, it is advised to add a message to let others know of your pushes. 
    <br> You are now ready to use GitHub in VS Code!
